# UnbeatableTicTacToe

This Angular project is an interactive game of tic-tac-toe against an unbeatable bot.

The player can choose to turn the bot off and play on their own. Or, they can choose to play against a bot. They also have the option of choosing who goes first. The bot uses the minimax algorithm to guarantee at least a tie.
